# About Me
Hi! I'm Haodi Hua, a software developer from Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. I'm always eager to connect with others who share my interests, exchange ideas, or team up on exciting projects. Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in Python and JavaScript while studying at MITT to gain hands-on software development experience.

My passion lies in game engine and language learning, and exploring innovations in AI and automation. I love tackling challenges that require creative problem-solving and pushing my technical boundaries. Whether it's coding or collaborating, I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to find fresh solutions.
